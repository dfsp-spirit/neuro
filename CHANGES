neuro Changes
=============


Current WIP
-----------
NEW:
- Add lots of documentation, including more detailed doc strings and a full MGH/MGZ demo application.
- Add a changelog in file CHANGES (this file)

FIXED:
- The `Mgh` struct now has public fields `Header` and `Data`, instead of private fields `header` and `data`.

CHANGED:
- The parameter `isGzipped` of functions `ReadFsMgh`, `ReadFsMghHeader` and `ReadFsMghData` now additionally accepts the strings `'mgh'` (alias for `'no'`) and `'mgz'` (alias for `'yes'`). This change is backwards compatible.
